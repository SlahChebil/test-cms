# Project Name: Content Management System (CMS)

This project implements a simple Content Management System (CMS) with a backend built using **Express.js** and a frontend built with **React**. The CMS allows you to manage words and phrases in two languages, with support for search and pagination.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure that you have the following tools installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (v16 or later) and **npm** (or **yarn**)
- **SQLite** (for the database)

### Backend Setup (Express.js)

The backend is built using Express.js and serves the data to the frontend. The data is stored in an SQLite database.

#### 1. Install Backend Dependencies

Navigate to the backend directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```
#### 2. Run the Backend
```bash
npm run seed
npm run dev
```
### Frontend Setup (React)

npm run dev
```
